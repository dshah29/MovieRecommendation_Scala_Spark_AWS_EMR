# MovieRecommendation_Scala_Spark_AWS_EMR

We have developed a movie recommendation engine which would recommend movies to users, based on the ratings provided by other users. Recommendation systems are a very integral part of e-commerce websites as well as other service providers like online streaming (Netflix, Prime Video, etc) and many others. 

Amazon has its own recommendation system which we often tend to use (“People who bought this also bought these items”). Netflix recommends movies based on preferred genres and ratings by users. There are multiple methods for recommendation - Content based, Collaborative and Hybrid methods. Content based methods use all the information about a particular user to customize the services offered. Collaborative methods assume that similar users prefer similar items. And Hybrid methods make use of both above mentioned models to achieve recommendation system. 

In this project, we will be focusing on the Collaborative systems. In order to do that, we would need to preprocess the data, use machine learning algorithm to operate on the data, evaluate the model and test the system. The final product of the project will be system which would recommend a list of movies to user based on his/her input.
